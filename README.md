# sql-alchemy-challenge
Repo for Chris Kilkes' Week 10 / Module 10 SQL Alchemy challenge - Chris Kilkes 04/15/24 @ 6:00 pm PST 

# What the project does: 
Analyzes precipitation and station data for total observable precipitation amongst US Weather Service stations located in Hawaii California. Use of SQL Alchemy tools allows users to query Hawaii combined precipitation and station data to analyze: Precipitation levels, list stations whose data contributes to precipitation analysis, query total observable precipitation levels, as well as input specific start and then start & end date to query the combined database for specific precipitation levels by date and time period as desired.

# How users can get started with the project: 
Download, run analysis and evaluate results for self. SQL Alchemy code and results provided for guidance: The "resources" folder contains the original CSV files containing the data used to build the SQL tables used in this exercise, as well as the SQLLite database itself for querying. The "Climate Starter-Final" Jupyter notebook provides the code for the combined database creation as well as the initial precipitation and total observable database queries. The "App.py" python notebook contains the code for the Flask app allowing for the direct querying of the database by users themselves. One note: For the "Start" and Start/End Date" routes in the Flask app, please enter "YYYY-MM-DD" formatted dates in order to pull the appropriate data for "TMIN, TAVG, TMAX" precipitation levels for specific dates and time periods. 

# Resources used for building SQL project include:
Multiple sources such as: I referenced official Bootcamp course material and documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools,  content as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
